## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need to have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Initialize Project & Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run:

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    npm install express body-parser ejs
    ```

2.  **Setup Project Structure:**
    Ensure your project follows this file structure:

    ```
    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ public/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles.css      # Your CSS file
    â”œâ”€â”€ views/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ejs       # Main quiz page
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ score.ejs       # Quiz completion page
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ partials/
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ header.ejs  
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ footer.ejs  
    â””â”€â”€ index.js            # Your main server code (containing Express logic)
    ```

3.  **Populate Files:**
    Copy your final Node.js logic into `index.js`, your latest EJS code into `views/index.ejs`, and the final CSS into `public/styles.css`.

### Running the App

Start the server from your project directory:

```bash
node index.js
